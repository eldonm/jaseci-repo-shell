# Encoders

Text encoding is a process to convert meaningful text into number / vector representation so as to preserve the context and relationship between words and sentences, such that a machine can understand the pattern associated in any text and can make out the context of sentences.

Jaseci Kit provides the following optimized text encoders:

- [USE Encoder](jaseci_kit/modules/encoders/use_enc/README.md)
- [USE QA](jaseci_kit/modules/encoders/use_qa/README.md)
- [FastText](jaseci_kit/modules/encoders/fast_enc/README.md)
- [Bi-Encoder](jaseci_kit/modules/encoders/bi_enc/README.md)
